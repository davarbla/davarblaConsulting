## Disclaimer

It is important to note that while auditing can significantly reduce the risks of vulnerabilities in a smart contract, it can never guarantee the complete absence of vulnerabilities with 100% certainty. Auditing is a process of analyzing the code and identifying potential security risks, but it does not guarantee that all vulnerabilities have been discovered or that new ones will not emerge in the future.

Therefore, it is important to understand that the security of a smart contract is a continuous process and requires ongoing monitoring and updating. It is highly recommended to regularly review and update smart contracts, even after an audit, to ensure their continued security.

While I strive to provide the most accurate and reliable information possible, I make no claims or guarantees about the completeness or accuracy of the information provided. Any reliance on the information provided is solely at your own risk.
