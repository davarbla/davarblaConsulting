# Blockchain Auditing Service

## Overview

Welcome to my professional smart contract security auditing service! In an era where blockchain technology is increasingly integrated across industries, ensuring the security of smart contracts is paramount. With my extensive expertise in smart contract auditing, I offer specialized services to help you safeguard your smart contracts against vulnerabilities.

My auditing process involves a meticulous examination of smart contract code using industry-leading tools and methodologies. This thorough approach aims to identify and mitigate potential security risks effectively.

I prioritize confidentiality and treat your project's information with the utmost discretion. My commitment is to deliver reliable, professional, and efficient service, ensuring your smart contracts are secure and resilient.

I understand the importance of maintaining confidentiality and will treat your information with the utmost discretion. I am committed to providing you with reliable, professional, and efficient service, ensuring that you can confidently deploy secure smart contracts.



## Auditing Process

Optimizing each stage of the auditing process involves close collaboration with project developers to ensure clarity and precision.

1. Initial Assessment: A comprehensive review of the protocol's functionalities, architecture, and design to define the audit scope, dependencies, and lines of code (SLOC) in the smart contracts.

2. Threat Model: Constructing a threat model based on protocol actors and their permissible actions.

3. Static Analysis: Utilizing industry-standard tools (like Slither, Mythril, Solhint, Manticore) to analyze the code for issues such as incorrect function declarations, formal verification, and adherence to best practices

4. Manual Analysis: Conducting line-by-line scrutiny of smart contracts through simulated testing environments and unit tests. This step ensures detection of potential security risks not identified in static analysis. I employ frameworks like Foundry to simulate diverse attack scenarios.

5. Reporting: Delivering a detailed report outlining vulnerabilities, their severity, and recommended remediation steps. The report includes a summary of audit findings and suggestions for enhancing smart contract security. Refer to my auditing checklist and report template for detailed insights

6. Remediation: Assisting development teams in addressing identified vulnerabilities promptly. I offer ongoing support and guidance during the remediation process.


7. Follow-up Audit: Recommending a follow-up audit to confirm vulnerability resolution and ensure sustained smart contract security. This step identifies any emerging issues during the remediation phase.

## Pricing

My flexible pricing model focuses on delivering value while accommodating budget considerations, particularly for startups and small businesses. You only pay for identified findings, ensuring transparency and cost-effectiveness tailored to your specific security needs.

## Questions before Audit

Before commencing the audit, addressing the following questions will guide effort estimation, payment, and timeline

1. What is the clear scope (.sol files) of the security review ?
2. On what chains are the smart contracts going to be deployed?
3. Please list any known issues/acceptable risks that should not result in a valid finding.
4. Does the project have well written specifications & code documentation?
5. What is the code coverage percentage?
6. Are there any protocols that are similar to yours, which are they?
7. Is the admin/owner of the protocol/contracts TRUSTED or RESTRICTED?
8. Which ERC20, ERC721, ERC777 tokens do you expect will interact with the smart contracts?
9. Have you had any audits so far, are you planning to do other audits/security programs as well?



## Security review result & fixes review

Upon completion of the security review, a detailed report will be provided. The project has 7 days to implement fixes for identified issues. Each fix should be submitted in a separate commit referencing the specific issue. I offer one free "fixes review" iteration to verify the correctness and security of your adjustments.

## Disclaimer

While auditing significantly mitigates vulnerabilities, it cannot guarantee complete absence or future emergence of vulnerabilities. Smart contract security necessitates ongoing monitoring and updates to maintain resilience. While I strive for accuracy, the provided information is subject to your own risk assessment.
